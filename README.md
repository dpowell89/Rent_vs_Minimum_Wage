# Rent vs Minimum Wage

## Overview
With this project I am looking at the relationship between minimum wage in states and comparing them to the average rent in popular cities within those states. I am looking to see if your average, every day worker can make ends meet while being on minimum wage or if changes need to happen.


### The Data 

The minimum wage data used within this project was pulled from a data set on Kaggle, which contains minimum wage information for every state from 1968-2017 which can be found here (hyperlink). I used this to track the minimum wage across the specific states I chose for this project to see if there were any drastic changes in minimum wage or if the rate had stayed the same over the years. The other data used in this project was found here (hyperlink), which shows me the average rent for 3 bedrooms, 2 bedrooms and single bedroom apartments across certain cities. This data is tracked from 2011-2018 per month for each year. 

###  My Approach 

My initial approach to this project was to see how much annually and monthly a person who works a job making minimum wage makes. Then after that I would need to see how much of that goes towards rent each month.

### Steps
#### Calculations 
	1. First step for me was to go through and decide on what cities/states that I wanted to work on for this project. I initially only wanted to do Nashville, TN but then branched out and included Los Angeles, CA and Austin, TX. 
	2. Step two was to go through and see how good/clean the data I had on minimum wage on those areas. Once that was done I would then move towards calculating their weekly paychecks (40 hours/week), monthly paychecks (weekly paycheck * 4), then their annual salary (weekly paycheck * 52). All of these numbers are pre-tax.
	3. Step three was to then look at the cities themselves and go in and calculate the average rent for the year, spanning from 2011-2018. I would take the data at hand then average out the 12 months for the year which would then give me the average rent for a one bedroom apartment in that city. 
#### Logic 
	

 - After seeing my findings with the calculations and just how bad it was for a person on minimum wage, I started to look into other factors. I found that there was a study done by MIT (hyperlink), that would calculate the living wage for states based on counties or major cities. 
 - I decided to run the same calculations as above but using the living wage instead of the minimum wage to see how well that would stack up. The results were surprising in some areas of the country and expected in the rest.
 - Lastly, I found the proposed bill to raise the national minimum wage to $15 an hour so I decided to run the calculations on that to see what that would do to a person's life. Again the results were expected in majority of cities but in some I was surprised at what was found. 

## Final Notes

 - This was the steps taken to form up this project. If I were to continue this project I would eventually go through and create a template to allow you to go through and calculate how well the minimum wage is doing in every capital/main city in each state across America. 
 - Overall this was a fun and eye opening project to work on. I knew minimum wage hasn't been changed/looked at in many years in some states but the housing/apartment market has continued to grow. I did not think that the numbers would be this bad, which I hope this brings to light that we need to start looking at minimum wage and seeing what we can do to increase it so people can start building better lives for themselves.
